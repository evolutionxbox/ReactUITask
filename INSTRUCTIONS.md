# Instructions

1. Please create a button with tooltip functionality using REACT as demonstrated in Zeplin designs included in this document.
1. Please set up a new REACT environment where you will demonstrate the task. Setup details included in this document.
1. Please include all of the details that are specified in the designs:
   - Hover state for the button & tooltip,
   - correct colours and styling, shadow,
   - tooltip sample with icons (icons attached) in ZIP file,
   - Tooltip should appear and disappear when button is clicked.
   - Users should be able to close the tooltip also by clicking/tapping outside of the button&tooltip.
1. Please create the component in a way it can be shared with other developers and other software development teams to pick up and use with their own content. It means that the behaviour of button and tooltip should be fixed and defined, but others should be able to easily customise the icon(s) and label(s), and also the width of the button and tooltip to fit longer content.
1. Demonstrate what’s the best way how to go about creating shareable components.
1. Demonstrate what’s the best way how to go about protecting the fundamental component so it can’t break or be compromised
when customised by others.
